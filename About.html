<h1> Who am I? </h1>

<div class= "about">
<p>
Hi! I’m a girl from a small but yet cool country called Estonia! Currently I’m studying User Experience Design in The Hague University of Applied Sciences and living therefore also in the Hague, Netherlands. I am addicted to travelling and having crazy adventures. That’s why I also chose to live and study in a foreign country to see another cultures and to become more independent by living alone far away from home. So far I’ve travelled quite a lot for my age. Thanks to my crazy cool parents I’ve visited many European countries and been to super awesome amusement parks and different activities. Last year I started taking part of youth projects to see and understand the life of people who live far away from me. 
Through youth projects I’ve visited many countries. My first project in June 2015 was to Italy. We lived in a eco village in the mountains with no Internet and explored perma-cultural way of living in the nature. This project was followed by a project in August when I visited Latvia. ‘’Eye on you(th)’’ was about video making and unemployment among youth.
Few months later I felt again the wanderlust and decided to go to England. This time we lived in a small village called Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire. The MAD (Movement, Arts, Dance) project was about exploring different dance styles and creating art. In 2016 I went to Romania again to the mountain area Poiana Negrii. This time the main topic was about healty lifestyle. Besides following the program of the project I’ve met so many inspiring and nice people and had crazy adventures and these projects triggered me to making the big step of moving to a new country this September. 
 Life in the Hague was quite overwhelming at first but now I almost feel like I live here. Moving to a foreign country has made me more confident and independent and taught me more about life than any self-help textbook could ever have done. So far I’ve lived here almost four months and I would have never imagined the time running so fast and I’m so happy for all the opportunities and adventures I’ve encountered. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all!
