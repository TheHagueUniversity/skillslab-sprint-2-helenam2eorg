    <h1> User Experience Design </h1>
    <p> Don’t worry, while there will be a lot of introductory courses in the first year we won’t bury you in books. On the contrary, from day one at UXD you will communicate with real companies (like Philips, IKEA and Google) on how your killer idea can change the way people use daily products. Key in this first year is getting an understanding of the users and their interaction with technology. To accompany the professional experience you will gain from working with these assignment providers, you will need to be taught the basics, which include: communication, prototyping, persuasive experiences, technical designing, and programming. The latter will allow you to turn simple ideas into mediated experiences across various digital and physical platforms. To express you ideas digitally, you will familiarise with a range of programming languages, such as: the front-end and back-end of web technologies, mobile platforms (Android and iOS), processing, Arduino and sensor technology.</p>
