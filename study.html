    <h1> User Experience Design </h1>
    <p> 
I am studying in The Hague University of Applied Sciences. My study is called User Experience Design which is basically a combination of research, design and programming and so far I’m still really happy and confident of my choice of study! Studies here are really practical and focus a lot on group work which for me is the perfect approach of learning. The program consists of three intense years and besides studying here in the Hague we have to do two internships also along the way which is a great opportunity to see and learn from the actual work field. Keep curious and follow your heart!
